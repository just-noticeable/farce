## The Judicial Pageantry

Imagine a woman who is raped, and there being no other witness, other than the absconding rapist. The woman is dutifully asked by the police if she has any proof, of having been drugged and raped, or molested. If the perpetrator used a condom and was careful enough to make the rape or molestation appear consensual, or confusingly non-existent, then what options remain available to the victim? These are the only remaining options for her: 

1. Parade herself to a police station
1. Have multiple "investigators" and "triage workers" dig into her character to establish whether she is even sane and isn't merely making up a story.
1. Get re-traumatized each time she is paraded in front a "confidential aid" who says that if she is the only person bearing her truth than how can anyone be convinced that her experience is genuine without a separate corroborator?
1. Provide a drug test, which eventually confirms that her body has traces of a particular set of narcotic substances, though she swears to never have been a drug user.
1. Wade through repeated psychological evaluations or "psych-evals."
1. Go through each round of the overall pageant, to show off her talents at "staying calm" while being thoroughly aggravated and enervated, by each doubt cast upon her sanity and personhood. 

It is certainly imaginable that a false testimony can be provided by a cunning person to besmirch, or blackmail, an individual who has not committed a rape or a similar sexual offense. However, the main point of the discussion here is to fully consider *the worth of a person's solitary truth.* A truth that is belittled and denigrated via the maxim that a statement is unworthy, and baseless, unless the person providing it is able to have their truth corroborated in such a way that, it can convince others. 

Now, imagine if the rape victim was a poor Muslim woman of colored skin, a maid working in a hotel as a migrant, with little understanding of local culture and difficulty communicating in English; accusing a rich European-like white male having strong financial and political powers, who drugged her by smothering her face with a cloth laced with fentanyl and formaldehyde from behind her, who then conveniently left to his city or country of origin, dumping the victim behind in the hotel, in a fancy boutique hotel that supplies poor victims to influential sex tourists. These tourists and business persons come to Northern Ontario, Canada to exploit a form of sex trafficking, where hotels and motels knowingly supply low income workers as well as the tools and tactics, to satisfy the fetishes of their high income patrons. The unwitting workers desperate for any wages are easily snared by criminal organizations with the backdrop of the world's worst economic recession packaged in a pandemic (during the year 2020).

The most insidious social engineering hack orchestrated by our society via the maxim of needing to convince "the others" about an issue, is when a jury of others is a pack of violators and criminals who have usurped judicial and social authority, or a cluster of uneducated stooges looking to turn a blind eye to "all the negativity and pessimism being presented!" 

Such is the plight of most victims of any crime, particularly crimes of human trafficking committed under the guise of aid to refugees.
