## Existing Patterns of Derelict Behaviours Among State-Sponsored Entities in India

Dear Gentle Reader,


Please be aware of the "patterns of derelict behaviours" being conducted by various incumbent officers of the current Government of India (GoI), that are being orchestrated in concert with various and several, colluding professionals in each sector of industry and commerce within India. Those deleterious behavioral patterns include, but are not limited to:

- Keeping the positions and office of the President of the *Ethics and Medical Registration Board,* of the *National Medical Commission,* vacant for years, so as to thwart complaints filed about ethical and medical malpractices against bad doctors and misbehaving medical institutes.

- Appointing incompetent and negligent officers in state level Medical Councils who willfully turn a blind-eye to complaints submitted about ongoing wrongdoings of bad medical practitioners and healthcare providers, in states like Telangana and New Delhi. 

- Handicapping and wounding the functioning of state level *Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission* by not appointing a full, three-member panel and tribunal of the said Commission in states like Telangana, since the year 2014. "How can an overloaded three-wheel rickshaw ever work properly on merely one or two wheels?"  

- Not appointing a Commissioner for the *Human Rights and RTI Commission* since the year 2022, in many states of The Republic. This is how the "appeals process" for the legislated by the *Right To Information Act, 2005,* has been deliberately handicapped by the incumbent GoI. 

Such cunning tactics for disabling the proper functionality of autonomous boards and commission have been rampant in India. Moreover, those autonomous or semi-autonomous entities sponsored by "The State", were otherwise constituted by Legislation for the good of the public and for promoting social equality. This is the plain and obvious evidence of the types of harmful tactics and habitual behaviours that the current Govt. of India, under the leadership of Mr. Narendra Modi, is attempting to commit yet again, by interfering with autonomous entities such as the *[Waqf Board.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Waqf_Council)*

Now, the actual legislative farce in India, among various industry sectors, is currently being orchestrated via the following types of cunning tactics for wounding and harming millions of innocent Consumers on a daily basis, so that those already injured Consumers can suffer pernicious forms of attrition and wastage:

1. *Section 53 of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019,* basically states that "no court" shall recognize an offence committed by medical practitioners or medical institutes or healthcare organizations, unless the said offence is first acknowledged and then petitioned to a court, by the designated officer of the National Medical Commission. 

	1. Thus, complaints about statutory crimes and serious violations of grievous hurt, bodily injuries, theft, abduction, fraud, sexual harassment, and other punishable offenses being committed by identifiable bad medical practitioners are first sent to the "Appellant Authority" at the state level Medical Councils governed by the National Medical Commission. In those Medical Councils, the designated offices are either vacant for years, or the designated officer is incompetent in adjudicating matters pertaining to issues such sexual violence and economic offences done in healthcare organizations. The officers responsible for maintaining and promoting appropriate ethical standards, conveniently feign lack of competence in adjudicating crimes involving fraud and other organized crimes. Worse, those incompetent officers, feign ignorance and intentionally turn a blind eye to the ethical malpractices of their cronies in the healthcare industry. 

	1. The notarized complaint has to then be sent to the designated officer of the National Medical Council, at added burdens and costs to the suffering victims and plaintiffs. But typically, that designated and responsible officer of the National Medical Council in New Delhi, either does not exist due to vacancy in that office position, or is the authorized officer is on an extended leave, or is currently being subject to judiciary actions for malfeasance and the replacement officer to do the necessary work is yet to be appointed. 
	
	1. So, due to the design of the state-sponsored organizations called Medical Councils, the formal complaints are sent to a dead-end or to a bureaucratic black-hole, so that the victims and survivors can suffer pernicious harms towards hopelessness and despair. On a daily basis, this is how, enumerable victims are forced by the systemic malfeasance and deliberate "dark patterns" baked into the governance structures of our nation, to either commit suicide or to silently suffer in agony, without any satisfactory relief to their ongoing suffering. 

	1. However, the legislated law in most states of India, similar or identical to the *Telangana Allopathic Private Medical Care Act, 2002,* posits that all complaints and grievances against Allopathic medical practitioners, institutes, and care-giving organizations including old-age homes and physio-therapy centers, <u>must<u> be presented only before a First Class Magistrate in a court of law. This factual and necessary law exists in most states of India because, any type of malpractice or malfeasance in a healthcare or a clinical setting, almost always results in grievous injuries and bodily hurt to the victims who suffer damages due to medical errors or managerial and information systems errors, within the context of their personal health and well being.
	
	1. There happens to be no statute or amendment to existing laws in India, that clearly and saliently explains the time period of limitation for filing cases involving medical malpractices and/or activities conducted based on "bad faith" by the professional staff in a clinical setting, that can be presented before a suitable magistrate or a judge. 

	1. Most importantly, ***Articles 13 to 35 of the Constitution of India*** posit that every Citizen and Resident in India, has the Fundamental Right to a proper hearing in a court of law, and to equitable legal protections against any type of exploitation, cruelty, wrongful confinement, and from recognized punishable offenses. Therefore, the existing professional healthcare providers and managers throughout the healthcare and education industry in India, repeatedly violate such foundational rights and liberties of Citizens and Residents, each time those professionals push the suffering victims or survivors towards Medical Councils or Consumer Forums or Education Boards or Medical Boards or non-judiciary Mediation or Lok-Adaalat or "out-of-court settlements", without providing written and forthright disclosures to Consumers and to aggrieved parties about such primary and foundational rights for firstly seeking a judiciary hearing in a court of law. It is indeed the sole responsibility of healthcare providers and institutes, to saliently and transparently make such necessary disclosures in a forthright manner, to Consumers and to any aggrieved parties seeking restitution from those healthcare providers and institutes.     

	1. As such, these are some of the ways in which, "Section 54 of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019," has continued to be derogatory and contradictory to the State's statutes governing Allopathic medicine in India, and has also been in contravention of the foundational laws in force via the Constitution of India, since the date of its inception and legislation. 
	
	1. Worst of all, due to such contradictions in how the laws are currently legislated and implemented, state and national level bureaucrats belonging to Medical Councils who are neither judges nor magistrates of the law, have been enjoying powers and abilities that exceed and dominate the judiciary powers vested in the officers of India's Magisterial Courts, Special Courts, High Courts, and Supreme Court. 
	
1. Similar to the above type of systemic faults and errors, that exist by design and not by any mistake or accident, *Sections 80 and 92 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, amended up to December 2024,* have also been in derogation to the State's laws governing Allopethic medicine in states like Telangana, and in abject contravention of the Constitution of India.  

	1. Therefore, by no means, were any victims or plaintiffs ever supposed to be sent to a Consumer Forum, especially by legal practitioners and policing agencies, without firstly filing a petition or a private lawsuit in jurisdictional court presided by a First Class Magistrate of the law. 
	
	1. The above-mentioned point is especially important because, healthcare and educational organizations in India been able to take undue advantages of the limitations of Medical Councils, Education Boards, semi-autonomous Accreditation Bodies, and Consumer Forums, to educate the felonies and punishable crimes that hidden within the day-to-day trade practices of identified and culpable educational organizations and healthcare providers. 
	
	1. Indeed, it is clearly evident that the *Ministry of Commerce, Industry, & Consumer Affairs* in India, has been operating its parallel court system, via the ruse of using Consumer Forums as qusi-judiciary bodies. These qusi-judiciary bodies end up unjustly favoring corporate entities because of the way they cause attrition to victims and deponents. This results in a National Security breach and ongoing issue, because domestic and foreign corporations are able to exploit this loophole within Consumer Forums to do harm to India's citizens and residents at large, while damaging India's national economy and industrial capacity. 
	
		>**The only remedial and necessary corrective action available, particularly in the interest of maintaining National Security & Sovereignty of India as a social democratic Republic, is to reconstitute Consumer Forums as sessions courts, under the Ministry of Law & Justice in India.** 
		>
		>**Until then, such a zero-day fault and a National Security problem will remain easily exploitable by foreign as well as domestic bad-actors, via simplistic hacks and routines directed via the existing functions of India's Consumer Forums.**    
	
1. The above-mentioned types of errors that have been installed by design, into legislative and judiciary processes are negatively impacting the general public in India, which happens to also include millions of foreign visitors and tourists. 

1. Now, those very same patterns of bad behaviours, are now being belligerently installed into the operations and activities of autonomous entities such as the Waqf Board. 

	1. Thus, various members of the incumbent GoI, are deliberately attempting to injure and destabilize the endowments procedures of the Waqf Board in India, that are to otherwise be maintained in accordance to Islamic heritage, customs, norms, and existing legal jurisprudence that respects religious freedoms and rights enshrined in the Constitution of India. 
	
It is obvious that, because various wrongdoers have been individually and collectively hiding behind indemnities offered to incumbent minsters and law makers, they have been able to get away with their bad behaviours and culpable activities in puncturing the Indian Supreme Court's functionality, through fragmented and state-sponsored entities such as Accreditation Boards and Regulatory Councils. 
The sly and cunning ways in which those state-sponsored wrongdoers have continued to injure and harm the public in general, is now being thrust upon innocent peoples with extremely prejudiced force, in a targeted manner. This is being done particularly by those insidious culprits, to suppress the Fundamental Rights of religious freedoms belonging to Jain, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Zoroastrian (Farsi), and other religious or ethic minority groups including Aadivasi and Dalit communities of India. 	

Who other than "Upper-Caste Hindu" leaders of right-wing groups operating from domestic and foreign bases, are to be held responsible for such tragic and widespread acts of injustice occurring in India?

### Important Note:

There is no form of human orchestrated legislation or political activity that has ever been, or can ever be, above The Law. Likewise, there are no persons or entities that can ever have primacy or efficacy, above and beyond The Law. 

So, discerning scholars and august citizens need to understand that: 

- "Nyāya" (<span lang="hi">न्यायः</span>), in the epistemic sense, only refers to the social and psychological activity of discerning things that are lawful, via human perceptions and cognitive abilities. 

- However, from ancient rites and customs that still hold true, "The Law" refers to: 

	- ["al Adalah" (عدالة)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalah_(Islam)) or ["Fiqh" (فقه)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh#History) or,  

	- ["Halakha" (הֲלָכָה)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha#Codes_of_Jewish_law) or, 

	- ["Guru Granth Sahib" (ਗੁਰੂ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ ਸਾਹਿਬ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Granth_Sahib#Meaning_and_role_in_Sikhism) or, 

	- [The Word (Logos | Λόγος)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)). 

The Law is referred by the above mentioned names in various cultures since antiquity, in the ontic sense that God within God's godly self, *is* the law. As such, conscientious human beings must abide by, and regard The Law as being perpetually inviolate, irrespective of human experiences and intellectual discussions.  

The Ultimate Judge, is also known as ["al ʿAdl" (ٱلْعَدْلُ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam#al-Tirmidhi's_list), which is one of the magnificent names of The Truth, and the Lord of the Worlds (al Haqu wa Rabbu al ealamin | <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">الحق ورب العالمين</span>).  

For practicing Muslims, Islam is The Law, which is revealed to skeptic human beings via the Quran, Angles, Prophets, and through the Signs (al Aayat | الآية), by Allah al Wakeel (The Ultimate Decision Maker), and is ontic to The Universe. 

>**Dedicating something to Allah via consecration or sacrifice, or devoting one's self to Allah through a covenant with Allah, is a religious right and a freedom, enjoined upon all Muslims, throughout the world.**
